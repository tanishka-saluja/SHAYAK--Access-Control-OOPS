# SAHAYAK – Access Controlled Micro-Loan System (OOPS)

## Problem Statement
Women entrepreneurs like Lakshmi face biased and non-transparent micro-loan approval
systems where intermediaries manipulate decisions and unauthorized individuals influence
loan outcomes.

## Solution
This project demonstrates a **role-based access control system** using pure Object-Oriented
Programming (Java) to ensure:

- Only **authorized bank verifiers** can approve or reject loans
- Any **unauthorized access attempt** is rejected and permanently logged
- Complete transparency and accountability in decision-making

## OOPS Concepts Used
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Single Responsibility Principle

## Key Features
- Role-based permission checks
- Clear authorization logic
- Handling and logging invalid access attempts
- Eliminates intermediary manipulation

## How to Run
```bash
javac src/*.java
java src/SahayakSystem
